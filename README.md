# OpenStreetMap
CS School Project - This C++ application provides an efficient method for navigating urban environments by calculating the shortest path between buildings using Dijkstra's algorithm. Users can input building names or abbreviations, and the program will return the optimal route, including the distance and detailed path.

This repository contains a C++ application designed for pathfinding in a graph representation of urban buildings and footways. The application utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two buildings based on user input. The graph is constructed from data representing nodes (buildings and footways) and their geographical coordinates. Key features include:

Graph Construction: Nodes and edges are dynamically generated based on the provided data structures, representing footways and buildings.
Shortest Path Calculation: Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently computes the shortest path between two specified locations, accommodating user-defined exclusions of certain nodes.
User Interface: Interactive console input allows users to specify buildings by name or abbreviation, receiving calculated paths and distances in response.
This project showcases concepts in graph theory, data structures, and algorithm implementation, making it a useful tool for urban navigation applications.
